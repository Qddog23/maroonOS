OS Install
    Use the Raspberry Pi Imager to install Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm (64 bit) with a Desktop environment onto a microSD card
        Use CMD + Shift + X to open the Imager settings (CTRL + Shift + X on Windows)
        Set hostname to 3da or 3db respectively

        Once the install is complete, insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on.
        Follow any on screen prompts to complete setup. You should be on the desktop environment before continuing onto the next step.

Screen Configuration
    Click the Raspberry Pi icon in the top left corner of the screen
    Go to Preferences > Screen Configuration > [Select Current Screen] > Configure > Orientation > [Select Correct Orientation to Make the Desktop Portrait]
    Click Apply, Ok, and then Close

Install Remote.it Client
    Follow this guide to install: https://docs.remote.it/software/device-package/installation

    At the time of writing, the quick install guide isn't working so we utilized the manual method.

    Finish setting up the remote.it client on the web dashboard
        Make sure to include the addition of the SSH and VNC service
        [Click on the plus sign next to the "Service" tag when the device is selected to add each service]

    Make sure to remove the installer file from the Raspberry Pi. It is no longer needed.

    Reboot the Raspberry Pi

Configure Device Settings
    Enable SSH
        Click the Raspberry Pi icon in the top left corner of the screen
        Go to Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > Interfaces
        Toggle SSH to "Enabled"
        Click OK

    Enable VNC
        Click the Raspberry Pi icon in the top left corner of the screen
        Go to Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > Interfaces
        Toggle VNC to "Enabled"
        Click OK

    Enable Auto Login
        Click the Raspberry Pi icon in the top left corner of the screen
        Go to Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > System
        Make sure the boot option is set to "To Desktop" and that "Auto Login" is toggled as "Enabled"
        Click OK

Get Dashboard Files
    Connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH

    Make sure you are in the home directory (use the command "cd /home/pi" to navigate to the home directory if not already indicated by "~")

    Working in the terminal, follow the steps below to get the files from GitHub:
        git clone https://github.com/Qddog23/maroonOS.git

Setup Dashboard
    Continuing in SSH, navigate to the maroonOS directory with the following command (assuming you are in the home directory):
        cd maroonOS

    Use the following steps to create the .env file:
        For Single Printer:
            touch .env.2
            nano .env.2

        For Three Printers:
            touch .env.1
            nano .env.1
            [repeat for .env.2 and .env.3]

        Copy the contents of the envTemplate.txt file into the .env file
        Fill in the necessary information (lots of which can be found on Connect - make sure you use the Prusa Link API key)
        Save and exit the file (CTRL + X, Y, Enter)

    Use the following steps to configure the server start:
        crontab -e
        (If prompted to select an editor, choose nano)

        For a Single Printer Setup, go to a free line and type the following:
            # Python Server Start
            @reboot /home/robocubs/maroonOS/server/serverStart.sh > /home/robocubs/maroonOS/server/startupErrorLogs/startup.log 2>&1
        
        For a Three Printer Setup, go to a free line and type the following:
            # Python Server Start
            @reboot /home/robocubs/maroonOS/server/maxServerStart.sh > /home/robocubs/maroonOS/server/startupErrorLogs/startup.log 2>&1

        Exit (CTRL + X) and save (Y)

    Use the following steps to configure the dashboard start:
        cd .config
        (assuming you are in the home directory - if it doesn't work try "cd ~/.config")

        mkdir autostart
        cd autostart
        touch maroonOS.desktop
        nano maroonOS.desktop

        For a Single Printer Setup, copy the contents of the dotDesktopTemplateSingle.txt file into the maroonOS.desktop file
        For a Three Printer Setup, copy the contents of the dotDesktopTemplateMax.txt file into the maroonOS.desktop file

        Save and exit the file (CTRL + X, Y, Enter)

Run Update Script (Necessary):
    cd ~/maroonOS/server
    sh pullUpdates.sh
